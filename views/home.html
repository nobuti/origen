<h1>About this</h1>

<p>It becomes increasingly important to maintain a consistent style and visual language across all areas of a web application. To do this, I have built the following tool to prototype components for faster product development.</p>

<p>It uses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gulp</li>
  <li>Sass</li>
  <li>Partials</li>
  <li>Webpack</li>
  <li>Browsersync</li>
</ul>
